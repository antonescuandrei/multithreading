# Multithreading

Homework for 14th May:

Starting from classes Counter (double attribute, volatile and synchronised methods), Adunare, Scadere and Test1 we already created and available on GitHUB, using package java.util.concurrency please rewrite the application using new classes and methods. How is this approach different from the initial one? How results are influenced by these?
